                    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">In 2016, we were set up to move the needle on what it means to provide a recruitment service to
                        businesses and people across the accountancy sector. We understand it’s more than simply matching
                        day-to-day skills to a role, but that companies and candidates also need to fit in their personality and
                        outlook.</p>
                    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="2000">That’s why we created our own data-driven approach that helps us unearth some of the talent within the
                        industry that typical recruiters can’t access. Using this data to support our experienced advisers
                        allows our approach to develop and thrive, where we build a more complete picture of candidates and
                        present only the highest-quality people to our clients.</p>
                    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="3000">In only a short space of time, we are proud to have already become a respected adviser in the sector and

                        and trusted relationships with clients and candidates alike. </p>
