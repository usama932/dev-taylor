We understand it’s more than simply matching day-to-day skills to a role, but that companies and candidates also need to fit in their personality and outlook.</p> <p>That’s why we created our own data-driven approach that helps us unearth some of the talent within the industry that typical recruiters can’t access. Using this data to support our experienced advisers allows our approach to develop and thrive, where we build a more complete picture of candidates and present only the highest-quality people to our clients.</p> <p>In only a short space of time, we are proud to have already become a respected adviser in the sector and are committed to changing the face of accounting recruitment as we continue to grow – forging long-term and trusted relationships with clients and candidates alike. </p> </div> <div class="about-content-right"> <p> Most importantly, throughout everything we do, you’ll see the core Taylor Hawkes values – where our experience, connections and deep-sector knowledge support our data to make the recruitment process more effective for everyone involved.</p> <p>In only a short space of time, we are proud to have already become a respected adviser in the sector and are committed to changing the face of accounting recruitment as we continue to grow – forging long-term and trusted relationships with clients and candidates alike.</p> <p>Most importantly, throughout everything we do, you’ll see the core Taylor Hawkes values – where our experience, connections and deep-sector knowledge support our data to make the recruitment process more effective for everyone involved.</p> </div> </div> </section> <section class="team-section"> <div class="section-title"> <h2>Meet our expert team</h2> <img src="/icon-arrow-right-white.53b92526.svg" alt="image"> </div> <div class="team-wrapper"> <ul class="team-list two-col"> <li class="team-item"> <div class="team-inner"> <a href="JavaScript:Void(0)" class="team-image"> <div class="team-info"> <h5>Peter Watson</h5> <p>Accountancy Practices Expert</p> </div> </a> <div class="team-content"> <p>Liam leads Taylor Hawkes' recruiting team of audit, outsourcing and financial reporting specialists.
